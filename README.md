# Exercise_Accounts

I have created this application with spring boot + maven + jap + junit \n
I have used MySql Workbench to make a database.
I have put Treasury values 0 or 1 to know if the account is treasury (value = 1) or it is not treasury (value = 0)
I have used Thymeleaf (a Java library) to attach hmtl files to controller.
I have used Mockito to make JUnit tests.
